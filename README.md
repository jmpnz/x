# eXperiments

This is a monorepo of bookmarks, notes, experiments and things.

In some cases I will link to other repos (since adopting this `x`
repo style I didn't want to move things around).

The idea for a monorepo for all small experiments, notes and such
is inspired from [Xe Iaso's own `x` monorepo](https://github.com/Xe/x).
