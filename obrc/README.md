# One Billion Rows Challenge in Rust

We try our hands at the [one billion rows challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) using
Rust starting from a naive baseline implementation and introducing improvements along the way.

The `flamegraphs` folder shows a captured flamegraph profile for each implementation the name
of each file is the name of the equivalent module.
